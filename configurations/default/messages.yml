r5Version:
  analysisVersionDifferent: WARNING: You have completed regional analyses with a different routing engine. Using different routing engines may change results.
  comparisonIsDifferent: WARNING: The analyses you are comparing ran on different routing engines. Changes in accessibility may be due to differences in the routing engines, rather than the transport scenarios.
  latestReleaseVersionNotSelected: An updated version of the Analysis backend is available. Changing versions should improve performance, but it may require a longer wait the first time you initialize a compute cluster for analysis. Using a different version may also change analysis results slightly.
